## Connecting Africa to the Internet: How BRCK is running Magma in Production

Around 800 million people in Africa donâ€™t have access to the internet. [BRCK](https://brck.com/) wants to change that by connecting people and things; getting individuals and businesses online and helping them fully utilize that access.

## What features drew you to Magma?

The orchestration and edge control allows our rural sites to operate with very high performance. Additionally the open source model enables our team to tweak the code to work with our unique product offerings.

## What is your Magma use case? 

BRCK is deploying low cost connectivity both urban and rural markets. We run Moja, our connectivity monetization platform that engages users to get connectivity for little or no cost to them. We operate networks in rural areas with often varied forms of backhaul including satellite and long range point to point and Magma helps us get further into the field.

## What is the scale of your Magma environment?  

10 sites

## What benefits has your organization experienced from using Magma? 

Magma's open source development has meant that we have been able to quickly get our platform up and running, making key modifications to the codebase that enable our product offering in a way that is scalable and manageable. By properly integrating Magma into our product and existing infrastructure we are able to scale efficiently. 

Magmas edge first model and lightweight footprint allows us to operate very low capex sites that perform very effectively at delivering highly reliable bandwidth to our users.

## What is your Magma configuration?

We operate Magma on our ruggedized SupaBRCK hardware, this also allows us to run edge (MEC) platforms that lower the opex of our connectivity platforms and products. We have developed a number of key tools around Magma that allow it to integrate with our existing site deployment and monitoring platforms.
